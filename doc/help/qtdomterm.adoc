= qtdomterm - terminal emulator and multiplexer using Qt
endif::[]

== Synopsis

`qtdomterm` [options] [command arguments ...]

`qtdomterm --connect` <url>

== Description
Normally (if `--connect` is not specified) this command is the same as
the `domterm` command, except for using the QtWebEngine browser engine
as the default user interface.

The `--connect` option is used when `qtdomterm` is invoked
by the backend to display a session in a QtWebEngine browser engine.
This option is not meant to be typed directly by a user.
In this case `qtdomterm` is only used for the user interface.
