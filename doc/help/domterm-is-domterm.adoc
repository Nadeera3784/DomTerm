== Synopsis

`domterm` [_goptions_] `is-domterm`

== Description



Succeeds (exits with code 0) if the current terminal is DomTerm;
fails (exits with code -1) otherwise.

This test does not depend on environment variables, but instead sends
a special request code, and checks the response. This test works over
an ssh connection. (The test does require that either DOMTERM be
non-empty, or that TERM be either empty or contain the string xterm;
otherwise it does not try to the request code.)

Typical shell usage: `if domterm is-domterm; then ...; fi`
